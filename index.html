        <p>Hello there. My name is Bahaar Rokhva (you counted right, I have 4 a’s in my name). Very nice to virtually
          meet you. If you’re here to check out my design work hit the portfolio tab, quick. Before I launch into a long
          winded bio. While you’re there feel free to reach out if you have a project we could work together on.
        </p>
        <p> Now for the promised long winded bio. My first name means ‘spring’ in farsi. While my name is an import, I
          am
          not. I was born and raised in exotic Sandy, Utah (one of Salt Lakes’ 87 suburbs). I continued the Utah trend
          by going to the University of Utah, I graduated with a B.S. in Multidisciplinary Design. Which is a really
          verbose way of saying that I’ve come face to face with a whole spectrum of design (ranging from physical
          products to pixels) while in school. Currently I’m working as a UX designer, with pixels, buttons and
          typefaces, all of which I am equally passionate, and OCD about. At work I enjoy data visualization, long
          awkward pauses on conference calls and user research. Outside of work you’ll find me walking my adorable long
          bodied dog, Olive, and playing soccer.</p>
